            <p>Coding with Fleet just got faster with generative AI
Today we announced JetBrains AI Assistant, which brings powerful new features including AI chat, AI-based refactoring and code completion, and the ability to generate documentation and commit messages. These new capabilities are available in the 2023.3 versions of all our commercial IDEs and ReSharper, as well as in Fleet.

AI Assistant offers a faster and even more efficient way to work with Fleet. In June 2023, we announced limited access to the AI-powered features. Now you can explore the improved Fleet experience and sign up for a 7-day trial to begin chatting with AI on programming topics, generating code and documentation, or getting help in the terminal.

To start the free trial, select AI Assistant from the Tools menu or invoke an AI-powered action from the Actions menu, and then log in using your JetBrains Account.</p>

                    <p>AI Assistant is an exciting new improvement, but there are even more features to explore in 1.28:

The Run and Debug tool is at the core of Fleet, and we are constantly working to improve this functionality. With this update you can now effortlessly delete configurations directly right from the Run and Debug popup, which makes configuration management more efficient and user-friendly. We’ve also revamped the Run configurations dialog, replacing the Copy to Clipboard action with one that conveniently pastes its content directly into run.json.</p>

                            In this first part of our blog post series, we’ve defined the most common Rust compiler errors based on the usage data available in RustRover and discussed errors ranked from 10 to 6. In the next part, we’ll explore the top 5 most popular errors and also try to answer the question that’s on every Rust developer’s mind: “Which part of Rust is the most troublesome?”.
