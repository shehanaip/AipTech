            <p>The Rust compiler is a picky creature. If it’s unhappy with the source code it’s fed, it can emit more than 400 different errors (with more being added every month!). Some of the errors are extremely rare, while others complicate the lives of Rust developers on a daily basis. In this blog post series, we’re going to look at the most common Rust compiler error messages that developers encounter in Rustify, a dedicated Rust IDE by Aiptech, and tips for how they can be avoided. But first, let’s see what we actually mean by “the most common errors”.</p>

                    <h1>Identifying the most common errors from Rustify’s usage data</h1>
                </div>

                    <p>Any Rustify user may opt-in to enable sending their anonymous usage data to Aiptech. By analyzing this data, we can observe various user patterns and gain insights into how to improve the IDE. Of course we take your privacy seriously, so the IDE collects very limited information. For example, nothing in the data is ever traceable back to the user. Even with anonymized data, we can learn about IDE usage in general – like what kinds of error messages are generated most often.

Whenever a user who has opted-in initiates the Cargo Build command through the IDE (for example, by triggering a Run configuration that requires building a project) and the Rust compiler emits an error, we record an error code. This doesn’t include all of the code issues that come up as users write their code, but only those that remain after they build their project. The intermediate errors are often fixed by taking advantage of the inspections and quick-fixes that the IDE provides. The more users send us their usage data and the more often they use Rustify, the better we can understand their experience and the more we can improve the IDE’s code assistance features. So, thanks to everyone who opts-in and whose usage data helps us make Rustify better for all!

We collected the error codes from users running Rustify and ranked the errors based on how many users encounter them. This part of the series discusses the errors ranked 10th to 6th most common, and the next installment will reveal the top five most common ones. We’ll look at the reasons behind these errors, explore simple examples, and discuss potential ways to fix them.</p>

                    <h1>Common error #10: E0412 (A used type name is not in scope)</h1>
                    <div>
                        <p>Rust maintains a strict distinction between type declaration sites and type name usages. Every type name (including generic types) must be declared somewhere and be available in the scope in which it’s used. If the compiler comes across a type name usage but doesn’t have any information about its declaration site, it emits E0412. About 12% of Rustify users have experienced this error at some point.</p>

                            Rustify provides plenty of autocomplete features. For example, let’s start by introducing a regular expression into our code:
                            </p>
                            </div>

                            In this first part of our blog post series, we’ve defined the most common Rust compiler errors based on the usage data available in RustRover and discussed errors ranked from 10 to 6. In the next part, we’ll explore the top 5 most popular errors and also try to answer the question that’s on every Rust developer’s mind: “Which part of Rust is the most troublesome?”.
