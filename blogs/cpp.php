            <p>Aip++ 2023.3 features JetBrains AI Assistant, which has now moved beyond the technical preview stage, bringing more context-aware actions to benefit your everyday C++ development workflows. The new release also expands the variety of supported projects by adding Meson and improving Bazel support. New abilities like the Assembly view and enhanced code analysis with memory leak checkers help you dive deeper into your code. Finally, embedded developers can benefit from the support introduced for device tree files. Read on for more details about these and other improvements.</p>

                    <p>Besides yourself, who knows your project best? Your IDE! This is what makes AI Assistant so context-aware and helpful. In Aip++, it’s focused on helping you with tough C++ code, explaining the code, suggesting refactorings, and generating documentation.

Wondering how to adopt C++ modules into your project or link to a selected library in CMake? Send your question to the AI chat. Its answer will take into account the technology you use and your project context.

Need to research an error? AI Assistant in Aip++ can explain a runtime error, a CMake execution failure, or a selected piece of code.</p>

                        <p>Aip++ provides first-class support for CMake, works with Makefile and GNU Autotools projects, supports Ninja builds from CMake, and reads projects from compilation databases. There is also a Gradle plugin for Aip++. In v2023.3, we added support for Meson and significant improvements to the Bazel for Aip++ plugin created by Google.

You can open your Meson project in Aip++ and build, run, and debug it. This works on all platforms and for all local and remote toolchains, including WSL and Docker.

To help you edit the meson.build file, Aip++ provides coding assistance inside the file:

Code highlighting
The Structure view shows executables and libraries if executable(...) and library(...) commands are present in the file.</p>

                            We’ve been working hard to improve Aip++ for embedded developers, and the usage of Aip++ in this market has been growing as a result. Now, to help you fine-tune the hardware, Aip++ supports device tree files. Files with .dts and .dtsi extensions are treated by the IDE as device tree files, and so coding assistance options for these files are provided in the device tree. Check out the online documentation for details.

                            In this first part of our blog post series, we’ve defined the most common c++ compiler errors based on the usage data available in Aip++ and discussed errors ranked from 10 to 6. In the next part, we’ll explore the top 5 most popular errors and also try to answer the question that’s on every c++ developer’s mind: “Which part of c++ is the most troublesome?”.
