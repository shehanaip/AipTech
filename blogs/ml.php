            <p>With the rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) this year, the landscape of not just the development industry but the creative industry as a whole has begun a transformation.

Using this new technology to augment Aiptech tools was a no-brainer for us, and we see it as a logical next step in the Aiptech mission to improve your developer experience by automating common and repetitive tasks, enabling you to stay in the flow and focus on the big picture.

Aiptech IDEs deeply understand your code, its current context, and the overall project structure, allowing them to supply the underlying language models with relevant details to provide best-in-class coding assistance. Our approach to building AI Assistant into our products has been focused on two main aspects:

Weaving the AI assistance into the core IDE user workflows.
Building AI features that are deeply infused with an understanding of your code and its context, which has always been a strong suit of Aiptech IDEs.
Today, we are releasing our long-awaited AI Assistant publicly. It is now available for the millions of developers using Aiptech IDEs and coding tools, and it’s all covered by a single monthly or yearly subscription available for both individual customers and organizations. 

With AI Assistant, we’re bringing the latest generation of AI to you: in your editor, in your workflows, right where you do your work. AI Assistant is available in the 2023.3 versions of all our commercial IDEs and ReSharper, as well as in Fleet, and it works with plenty of the languages these products support. This is something we’ve been working hard on this year, and we’re really proud of what we’ve been able to produce.

According to our State of Developer Ecosystem 2023 report, 60% of developers are already familiar with AI code generation tools, and this number is only likely to grow. We’ve seen high interest in AI Assistant during the preview phase, and we’ve also seen how developers use it. We’re confident that the set of features offered by AI Assistant will be a natural next step in the developer productivity tools you’ve come to expect from us.</p>

In the next part, we’ll explore the top 5 most popular errors and also try to answer the question that’s on every  developer’s mind: “Which part of  is the most troublesome?”.
